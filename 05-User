05-User
User is a microservice that is responsible for User Logins and Registrations Service in RobotShop e-commerce portal.

Hint
Developer has chosen NodeJs, Check with developer which version of NodeJS is needed. Developer has set a context that it can work with NodeJS >18

Install NodeJS, By default NodeJS 10 is available, We would like to enable 18 version and install list.

Hint
You can list modules by using dnf module list

dnf module disable nodejs -y
dnf module enable nodejs:18 -y

Install NodeJS

dnf install nodejs -y

Configure the application. Here

info
Our application developed by the user is not having any RPM software just like other softwares. So we need to configure every step manually

Recap
We already discussed in Linux basics section that applications should run as nonroot user.

Add application User

useradd roboshop

info
User roboshop is a function / daemon user to run the application. Apart from that we dont use this user to login to server.

Also, username roboshop has been picked because it more suits to our project name.

info
We keep application in one standard location. This is a usual practice that runs in the organization.

Lets setup an app directory.

mkdir /app 

Download the application code to created app directory.

curl -L -o /tmp/user.zip https://roboshop-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/user.zip 
cd /app 
unzip /tmp/user.zip

Every application is developed by development team will have some common softwares that they use as libraries. This application also have the same way of defined dependencies in the application configuration.

Lets download the dependencies.

cd /app 
npm install 

We need to setup a new service in systemd so systemctl can manage this service

info
We already discussed in linux basics that advantages of systemctl managing services, Hence we are taking that approach. Which is also a standard way in the OS.

Setup SystemD User Service

/etc/systemd/system/user.service
[Unit]
Description = User Service
[Service]
User=roboshop
Environment=MONGO=true
Environment=REDIS_HOST=<REDIS-SERVER-IP>
Environment=MONGO_URL="mongodb://<MONGODB-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS>:27017/users"
ExecStart=/bin/node /app/server.js
SyslogIdentifier=user

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

:::hint RECAP You can create file by using vim /etc/systemd/system/user.service :::

Load the service.

systemctl daemon-reload

info
This above command is because we added a new service, We are telling systemd to reload so it will detect new service.

Start the service.

systemctl enable user 
systemctl start user

Setup the MongoDB repo file

/etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo
[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1


Hint
Hint! You can create file by using vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo

Install MongoDB

dnf install mongodb-org -y 

Start & Enable MongoDB Service

systemctl enable mongod 
systemctl start mongod 

Usually MongoDB opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.

Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/mongod.conf

Hint
You can edit file by using vim /etc/mongod.conf

Restart the service to make the changes effected.

systemctl restart mongod


mongo --host 172.31.90.215 </app/schema/user.js
